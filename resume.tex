                       and Professor Matthew Caesar on a new project
                       that aimed to detect incompatibilities between
                       code sources.  Involves analyzing previous
                       literature in the field and coming up with a
                       model to support our project.

                    \item Vulnerability Discovery using a variety of
                      methods.  Developed a smart fuzzer and setup a
                      testing framework.  Found bugs via source code
                      auditing.  Worked with browser security
                      and applications on both x86 and ARM architectures.

                     an API to communicate with the robot via a web
                     and android application.  Also wrote applications
                     in python and C++.

  and store the results in a database.  I worked with 3 other
  students for a semester project in the Security Lab course.

  k-means algorithm.  This involved acquiring XML outputs from
  CWSandbox and modeling a feature-set from the results.  I wrote this
  as a final project for a statistics course.
